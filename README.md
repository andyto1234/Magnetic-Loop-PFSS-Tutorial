# Magnetic-Loop-PFSS-Tutorial

#### Andy To (MSSL/UCL) - 09 September 2023


This tutorial will demonstrate how to overplot field lines onto AIA/EIS maps using the Potential Field Source Surface model (PFSS)

This tutorial will slowly take you through modelling using PFSS. This example shows how to use the Python package Sunpy (the usual package to analyse the sun!), take a PFSS solution, trace some field lines, and overplot the traced field lines on an AIA 193/EIS map.
The different parts involve:

* Installation and Requirements
* Fixing EIS pointing using AIA, and plotting solar images
* PFSS extrapolation and visualising it using EIS and AIA
* Finally we can get the loop information like magnetic loop length, and field strength along loop.
